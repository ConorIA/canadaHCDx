\usage{
find_station_adv(name = NULL, province = NULL, baseline = NULL,
  type = "daily", ignore.case = TRUE, target = NULL, mindist = 0,
  maxdist = 100, sort = TRUE, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{name}{character; optional character string or a regular expression to be matched against known station names. See \code{\link{grep}} for details.}

\item{province}{character; optional character string to filter by a given province. Use full name or two-letter code, e.g. ON for Ontario.}

\item{baseline}{vector; optional vector with a start and end year for a desired baseline.}

\item{type}{character; type of data to search for. Only used if a baseline is specified. Defaults to "hourly".}

\item{ignore.case}{logical; by default the search for station names is not case-sensitive.}

\item{target}{numeric; optional numeric value of the target (reference) station, or a vector of length 2 containing latitude and longitude (in that order).}

\item{mindist}{numeric; minimum distance from the target in km. Only used if a target is specified. (defaults to 0)}

\item{maxdist}{numeric; maximum distance from the target in km. Only used if a target is specified. (defaults to 100)}

\item{sort}{Boolean; if TRUE (default), will sort the resultant table by distance from `target`. Only used if a target is specified.}

\item{...}{Additional arguments passed to \code{\link{grep}}.}
}
\value{
An object of class \code{"hcd_station_list"}, which is a \code{"tbl_df"}, containing details of any matching HCD stations.
}
\description{
Search for stations in the Historical Climate Data inventory name, available data, and/or distance to a target.
}
\examples{
# Find all stations containing "Regina" in their name.
find_station_adv("Regina")

# Find stations named "Yellowknife", with hourly data available from 1971 to 2000.
find_station_adv("Yellowknife", baseline = c(1971, 2000), type = "hourly")

# Find all stations between 0 and 100 km from Station No. 5051.
find_station_adv(target = 5051, mindist = 0, maxdist = 100)
